# Super Psyched

**Super Psyched** is an immersive, educational experience inspired by NASA’s Psyche mission. Players begin by guiding Kuiper, the mission leader, as they make their way to the control room. From there, they must complete a series of five engaging minigames, each simulating a unique aspect of the mission. Whether it’s spacecraft navigation or asteroid composition analysis, players will explore and interact with the science and technology behind the journey to Psyche.
